# whisper

Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. The Whisper architecture is a simple end-to-end approach, implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer, input audio is split into 30-second chunks and then passed into an encoder.

Pros 
-Whisper is trained on a large dataset of audio aiding in giving accurate answers
- Whisper can be used both from the command line and within Python code, providing flexibility in how it is integrated into different applications. Different models can be used for better performance.
- It can be used in any language and be used for translation as well

Cons 
-The larger models in Whisper require significant computational resources,which may pose challenges for users with limited resources
-It has a complex setup and installation.
